## MyStore

It's an angular project for shopping cart, such as product list page that displays all products where you can choose which product you need to but then choose your amount before adding to the cart.
also there's details page for every product that also you can add it to the cart, then you navigate to the cart to adjust the final amount of the products needed to be bought, as well as write your info to create your order.
Finally after submitting your info, it will redirect you to the confirmation page that will display successfull message with your name and the final price within shipping duration.     

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
